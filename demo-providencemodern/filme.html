A grown-up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry-eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup — Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) — who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record-breaking $50 million in its first week of release.</span></div></div><div class="medium"><div class="title">Legend - Director's Cut</div><img class="coverimage" src="covers/FF28EA5D-D5E3-46DB-A3FA-CCA7D9B6A967-185.png" width="131" height="185" /><div class="hidden"><span class="creator">Ridley Scott</span><span class="rating"></span><span class="description">Set in a timeless mythical forest inhabited by fairies, goblins, unicorns and mortals, this fantastic story stars Tom Cruise as a mystical forest dweller, chosen by fate, to undertake a heroic quest.

And here he is, phantom fiend Freddy Krueger in all his razor-fingered infamy. Wes Craven (Scream movies) directs this trendsetting first in the slash-hit series. The premise is simple: Freddy (Robert Englund) homicidally haunts the sleep of Elm Street teens. The results are terrifying and mind-blowingly innovative. There’s another film debut too: Johnny Depp. He plays the ready steady of the hottie mcsmarty (Heather Langenkamp) who figures a clever way to flambé the fiend. But ever-say-die Freddy will be 3, 4 back for more…even returning to the screen in a killer 2010 remake of this diabolical original.

From Wayne's basement the pair broadcast a talk-show called Wayne's World on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of Wayne's World-and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly but funny jokes on this thin plot and the energy of the cast-as well as the wild pop-culture references-make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie.</span></div></div></td>
